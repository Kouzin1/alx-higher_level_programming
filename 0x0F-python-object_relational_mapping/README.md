# Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project, I learned about how object-relational mapping is used for database scripting. I became familiar with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete tables in MYSQL.

## Task : page_with_curl:

* **0. Get all states**
  * [0-select_states.py](./0-select_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb to list all states in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
  * Usage: `./0-select_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password> <database name> `.
  * Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
