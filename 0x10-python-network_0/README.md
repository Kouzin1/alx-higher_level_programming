# Python - Network #0

In this networking project, I used `curl` in `bash` scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, Ilearned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/response header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the ovrall project theme completed in Python.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

NOTE: The `curl` behaviour in all `Bash` scripts were written to interact with a server set up on a container provided by ALX.

* **0. cURL body size**
  * [0-body_size.sh](./0-body_size.sh): Bash script that sends a `GET` request to a given URL and displays the size of the response body in bytes.

* **1. cURL to the end**
  * [1-body.sh](./1-body.sh): Bash script that sends a `GET` request to a given URL and displays the response body for a `200` status code response.

* **2. cURL Method**
  * [2-delete.sh](./2-delete.sh): Bash script that sends a `DELETE` request to a given URL and displays the response body.

* **3. cURL on Method**
  * [3-methods.sh](./3-methods.sh): Bash script that displays all HTTP methods the server of a given URL will accept.

* **4. cURL headers**
  * [4-header.sh](./4-header.sh): Bash script that sends `GET` request to a given URL with a header variable `X-School-User-Id=98` and displays the response body.

* **5. cURL POST parameters**
  * [5-post_params.sh](./5-post_params.sh): Bash script that sends a `POST` request to a given URL with the variable `email=test@gmail.com` and subject=I will always be here for PLD and displays the response body.

* **6. Find a peak**
  * [6-peak.py](./6-peak.py): [Technical interview preparation] - Python program that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
  * [6-peak.txt](./6-peak.txt): Text file containing the complexity of algorithm.
